<h1>How to Do a Title Page in MLA Format</h1>
<p>Many academic papers are written using MLA style. MLA style normally does not require a cover page because all the important information is worked into the first page. However, some instructors do prefer a separate title page. In that case, use the following standards.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Write the title about one third of the way down the page.</strong> The title should follow normal title capitalization standards: the first letter of each word should be capitalized with the exception of very short words such as articles or prepositions (e.g. the, and, of, or, a, an, in, to, for). Note that the very first word of the title should be capitalized, regardless of what kind of word it is.
<ul>
<li>Do not punctuate your title. It does not need to have quotation marks around it, it should not be underlined, and it should not be in italics. If, however, there is a quotation or a reference to a longer work in your title, that should be punctuated accordingly.</li>
<li>For example, "To Be or Not to Be:" An Analysis of Hamlet's Soliloquy contains a quote, while An Analysis of Inaction in Shakespeare's Hamlet contains the title of the play, which should be italicized.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Write the course or class information.</strong> You may want to include the section number as well as the name of the course.</li>
<img src="images/5.jpg">
<li><strong>Write the instructor's name on the next line.</strong> Be sure to include the appropriate title, particularly if your instructor has a doctorate. For example, Dr. Sarah Smith or Dr. Smith.</li>
<img src="images/6.jpg">
<li><strong>Write the date on the next line.</strong> MLA format generally calls for a European style date, with the day, then the month, then the year. For example, 2 February 2014.</li>
