<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I
pondered, weak and weary, Over many a
quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore - </p>
<ul>
<li>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,</li>
<li>As of some one gently rapping,</li>
<li>rapping at my chamber door.</li>
<li>"'Tis some visiter," I muttered,</li>
<li>"tapping at my chamber door - Only this and nothing more."</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Ah, distinctly I remember</p>
<ul>
<li>it was in the bleak December;</li>
<li>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</li>
<li>Eagerly I wished the morrow;</li>
<li> - vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow</li>
<li> - sorrow for the lost Lenore - </li>
<li>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p> - Nameless here for evermore.</p>
