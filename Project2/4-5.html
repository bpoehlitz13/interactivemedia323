<p>Once upon a <strong>midnight</strong> dreary,<br>
while I <strong>pondered,</strong> weak and weary,<br>
Over many a <strong>quaint and curious volume</strong> of forgotten lore-<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping,<br>
suddenly <strong>there came a tapping,</strong><br>
As of some one gently rapping,<br>
rapping at my chamber door.<br>
"'Tis <strong>some visiter,"</strong> I muttered,<br>
"tapping at my chamber door<br>
<strong>-Only this and nothing more."</strong><br>
Ah, <strong>distinctly</strong> I remember it was in <strong>the bleak December;</strong><br>
And each separate dying ember<br>
wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;<br>
-vainly I had <strong>sought</strong> to borrow<br>
From my books <strong>surcease</strong> of sorrow<br>
-sorrow for the lost Lenore-<br>
For the rare and <strong>radiant</strong> maiden<br>
whom the angels name <strong>Lenore</strong><br>
<em>-Nameless here for evermore.</em></p>
