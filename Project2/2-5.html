<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered,<br>
&nbsp <strong>weak and weary,</strong> Over many a quaint and curious<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp volume of forgotten lore - While I nodded,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp nearly napping,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>suddenly there came</strong> a tapping, As of some&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp one gently rapping,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp rapping at my chamber door. "'Tis some&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp visiter," I muttered, <em>"tapping</em><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <strong>at my chamber door</strong> - Only this and nothing more." Ah, distinctly <em>I remember</em><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow From<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lenore - For the rare and radiant maiden whom the<br>
&nbsp <strong>angels name Lenore</strong> - Nameless here for evermore.</p>
