<p>Once upon a midnight dreary,<br>
while I pondered,<br>
weak and weary,<br>
Over many a<br>
quaint and curious volume<br>
of forgotten lore - <br>
While I nodded,<br>
nearly napping,<br>
suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping,<br>
rapping at my chamber door.<br>
"'Tis some visiter,"<br>
I muttered,<br>
"tapping at my chamber door<br>
 - Only this and nothing more."<br>
Ah,<br>
distinctly I remember<br>
it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember<br>
wrought its ghost<br>
upon the floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;<br>
 - vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
From my books<br>
surcease of sorrow<br>
 - sorrow for the lost<br>
Lenore - <br>
For the rare and radiant maiden<br>
whom the angels name<br>
Lenore<br>
 - Nameless here for evermore.</p>
