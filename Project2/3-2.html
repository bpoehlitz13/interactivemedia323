<p>Once upon a midnight dreary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious<br>
While I nodded, nearly napping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping,<br>
"'Tis some visiter," I muttered,<br>
Only this and nothing more."<br>
Ah, distinctly I remember<br>
And each separate dying ember<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden</p>
</div>
<div id="redborder">
<p>While I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Volume of forgotten lore -<br>
Suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
Rapping at my chamber door.<br>
"Tapping at my chamber door -<br><br>
It was in the bleak December;<br>
Wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
- Vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
- Sorrow for the lost Lenore -<br>
Whom the angels name Lenore -<br>
Nameless here for evermore.</p>
