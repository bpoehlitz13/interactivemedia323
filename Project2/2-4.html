<h3>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore - </h3>
<h2>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.</h2>
<h4>"'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door</h4>
<h2>-Only this and nothing more."</h2>

<h3>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</h3>
<h4>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.</h4>
<h5>Eagerly I wished the morrow; - vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow - sorrow for the lost Lenore - </h5>
<h4>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore</h4>
<h1>-Nameless here for evermore.</h1></p>
