<div id="M"><h1>&nbspOnce upon a midnight dreary,&nbsp</h1></div>
<div id="N">&nbspwhile I pondered, weak and weary,&nbsp</div>
<div id="O">&nbspOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,&nbsp</div>
<div id="PL">&nbspWhile I nodded, nearly napping,&nbsp</div>
<div id="PR">&nbspsuddenly there came a tapping,&nbsp</div>
<div id="Q">&nbspAs of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.&nbsp</div>
<div id="SL">&nbsp"Tis a visiter," I muttered,&nbsp</div>
<div id="SR">&nbsptapping at my chamber door,&nbsp</div>
<div id="T">&nbspOnly this and nothing more."&nbsp</div>

<div id="UL">&nbspAh, distinctly I remember&nbsp</div>
<div id="UR">&nbspit was in the bleak December,&nbsp</div>
<div id="V">&nbspAs each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor,&nbsp</div>
<div id="W">&nbspEagerly I wished the morrow&nbsp</div>
<div id="X">&nbsp- vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow -&nbsp</div>
<div id="Y">&nbspsorrow for the lost Lenore -&nbsp</div>
<div id="ZL">&nbspFor the rare and radiant maiden&nbsp</div>
<div id="ZR">&nbspwho the angels named Lenore -&nbsp</div>
