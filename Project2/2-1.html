<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a <strong>quaint and curious</strong> volume of forgotten lore - <br>
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly <strong>there came a tapping,</strong><br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
"'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door<br>
-Only this and nothing more."<br>
<br>
Ah, distinctly I remember <strong>it was in the bleak December;</strong><br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
Eagerly I wished the morrow;  - vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
From my books surcease of sorrow <strong> - sorrow for the lost Lenore - </strong><br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore<br>
â€”<strong>Nameless here</strong> for evermore.</p>
